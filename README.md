# About
You survive on a spaceship and travel through asteroids and other space objects to loot. The main goal is to reach the edge of the solar system. But to do this, you'll need to single-handedly process space rocks, salvage wrecked ships, trade with passing ships, and defend yourself against space pirates. But are you alone on your own ship in this dark space?

<summary>Ship Controller</summary>

Using the controller, you can choose the path your ship will take.
At the end, there will always be an asteroid, another ship, a station, a teapot, or any other space object.
~~Along the way, an event may occur that can stop the ship, damage it, or otherwise interact with the ship and the player.~~ WIP

<summary>Ship Engine</summary>

Launching a ship is impossible without an engine or without sufficient fuel in the tank.
Don't forget about engine nozzles either. Their number directly affects maximum speed.
